        <h2>In <span class="highlight">   life,</span> the number of <span class="highlight">beginnings</span> is exactly equal to the number of <span class="highlight">endings:</span> no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.<br><br>In <span class="highlight">poetry,</span> the number of<span class="highlight">beginnings</span> so far exceeds the number of <span class="highlight">endings</span> that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is <span class="highlight">finished</span>—one poem is <span class="highlight">abandoned,</span> another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an <span class="highlight">ending,</span> but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</h2>

      <h2>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that <span class="highlight">no poem</span> is ever <span class="highlight">ended,</span> that every poem is merely <span class="highlight"></span>abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations <span class="highlight">begin</span> is in a cloud.<br><br> Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a <span class="highlight">poem,</span> he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall. </h2>

    <h2>In the <span class="highlight">beginning</span> was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <span class="highlight"></span>beginning</span> was the Act. that nothing can <span class="highlight">precede</span> action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. </h2>

<div class="bodytext">
  <h2>I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the <span class="highlight">end</span> of a poem than it is to talk about its <span class="highlight">beginning.</span> Because the poem <span class="highlight">ends</span> on the page, but it <span class="highlight">begins</span> off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the <span class="highlight">middle</span> of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.<br><br>An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! </h2>

  <h2>They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its <span class="highlight">beginning;</span> the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </h2>
