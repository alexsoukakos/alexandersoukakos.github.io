        <h2>As the poet <span class="highlight">Ralph Angel      </span> puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a <span class="highlight">circle</span> around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. </h2>

    <div class="bodytext">
      <h2>Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems <span class="highlight">begin,</span> the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a <span class="highlight">dead-end</span> alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </h2>

  <div class="bodytext">
    <h2>I believe many fine poems <span class="highlight">begin</span> with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea. </h2>

<div class="bodytext">
  <h2>Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence <span class="highlight">begins</span> with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and <span class="highlight">ends</span> with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence <span class="highlight">end.</span> </h2>
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
  <h2>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. </h2>
