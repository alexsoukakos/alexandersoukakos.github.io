        <h2>You might say a <span class="highlight">poem</span> is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the <span class="highlight">first</span> line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the <span class="highlight">first</span> and <span class="highlight">last</span> lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the <span class="highlight">first</span> and <span class="highlight">last</span> lines of a poem would not speak to each other. </h2>

    <div class="bodytext">
      <h2>Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you. I will tell you what I miss:<br><br> I miss watching a movie and at the <span class="highlight">end,</span> huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <span class="highlight">The End.</span> I miss <span class="highlight">finishing</span> a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the <span class="highlight">last</span> words of the <span class="highlight">last</span> sentence, are the dark letters spelling <span class="highlight">The End.</span>

    <h2>It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having <span class="highlight">finished</span> the book.</h2>

  <h2>I have never, in my life, read a poem that <span class="highlight">ended</span> with the words <span class="highlight">The End.</span> Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line.<br><br> And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words <span class="highlight">The End.</span> And I realized children very often denote the <span class="highlight">end</span> because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing. </h2>

  <h2>Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to <span class="highlight">finish</span> any piece of writing: the <span class="highlight">ending</span> will have the <span class="highlight">last</span> word or the <span class="highlight">ending</span> will be silent or the <span class="highlight">ending</span> will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent. </h2>

    <h2>Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing:<br><br>We begin in admiration and we <span class="highlight">end</span> by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the <span class="highlight">onset</span> of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.
